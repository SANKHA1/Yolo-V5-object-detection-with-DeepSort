# Yolo_V5-object-detection-with-DeepSort
Here I have tried to use Yolo_V5 for object detection in images and videos
1. Yolo_V5 is downloaded 
2. Install the requirements from requirements.txt
3. Keep any video in the same folder as track.py
4. Run track.py
5. The files 'Car_V5.jpg', 'Celeb_V5.jpg', 'yolo_v5 object detection.mp4' are the sample image and video outputs after object detection.
